# Billing Frontend Application

This is the frontend for the Billing application, built with React and TypeScript.

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to configure the API endpoint. Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

You can also use the provided `.env.example` file as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- Display billing information and order history
- Load data from the backend API with pagination
- Fallback to sample data if the API is unavailable
- Responsive design

## API Integration

The application integrates with the backend API to fetch billing data. The API endpoint is configured using the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable.

If the API is unavailable, the application will display sample data as a fallback.
